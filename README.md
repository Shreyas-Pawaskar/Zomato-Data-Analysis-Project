# Zomato Data Analysis Project

## 🎓 Introduction

Welcome to the Zomato Data Analysis Project! This project is designed to help you learn how to analyze and visualize data using Python, focusing on the data from Zomato. By the end of this project, you'll gain insights into customer behavior, restaurant preferences, and other critical metrics that drive business decisions.

## 📊 Project Overview

In this project, we will:
- Perform data analysis on Zomato's restaurant data.
- Visualize the data using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Analyze customer ratings, votes, and order patterns.
- Draw conclusions based on data insights and visualizations.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Restaurant Analysis**: Understand the types of restaurants and their popularity.
- **Customer Insights**: Analyze customer ratings and votes to uncover trends.
- **Order Patterns**: Explore how customers spend on Zomato and the difference between online and offline orders.
- **Data Visualization**: Use heat maps and other graphical tools to present findings effectively.

## 📈 Key Insights

- **Data Analysis Importance**: Data analysis is crucial for businesses like Zomato to derive meaningful insights and make informed decisions.
- **Restaurant Type Preference**: Customers prefer dining restaurants, which receive more orders.
- **Ratings Distribution**: Most restaurants have ratings between 3.5 and 4, indicating customer satisfaction.
- **Order Spending**: On average, couples spend around ₹800-1000 per order.
- **Online vs. Offline Orders**: Online orders tend to receive better ratings compared to offline ones.
